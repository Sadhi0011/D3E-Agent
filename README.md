The purpose of this project is to build an agentic application that generates D3E code (frontend and backend) based on user-provided prompts or specifications. The system leverages specialized agents (such as a frontend agent and a backend agent) to analyze requirements, translate them into D3E Studio concepts (like Models, Widgets, Pages, DataQueries, etc.), and produce ready-to-use D3E code and documentation. This streamlines the process of going from business requirements to working D3E application code, automating much of the analysis, design, and code generation workflow.
